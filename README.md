#This repository contains Python codes which generate random data and uploads them onto ThingSpeak Channels
#Visualizes the published Data using Matplot lib
#Samples of published data and visualizations

-> PublishData.py --> Publishes random data onto ThingSpeak website for 3 sensors in 2 environmental stations

-> Visualization.py --> Plots graphs for fields vs time for both stations

-> Figure1 and Figure 2 --> Sample graphs generated after running the PublishData and Visualization for a small period of time

-> feeds-Station1 and feeds-Station2 --> Data exported from ThingSpeak website after running PublishData.py for a certain time
